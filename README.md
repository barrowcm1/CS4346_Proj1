# Intelligent System Implemetation for Diagnosis Network Attacks

This is an application of Forward-Chaining and Backward-Chaining to design an intelligent system to diagonose various network attacks.

It uses the Backward-Chaining algorithm to determine what type of network attack a user may have endured, while the Forward-Chaining
algorithm is used to display the recommended solutions needed to solve and fix a specific network problem.

# How to Run the Program

To run the program from the command line simply enter the following comands:

g++ -std+c++17 Demo.cpp 
./a.out
